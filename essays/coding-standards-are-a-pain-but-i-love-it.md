# Pain 
Before this class I used the IDE called Eclipse for Java. This was really my only expereince with an IDE before. I enjoyed using it because of the environment. It was really user friendly and I enjoyed using it. On Eclipse it was nice that we could format the code to make it look nice, but using IntelliJ with ESLint changed everything. I mean using IntelliJ without ESLint was just like Eclipse, with ESLint it was different. I started doing the practice WODs and felt like my code was right, but I was still gettting errors. I did not understand why. I hovered over the errors and noticed the error had to do with the amount of spaces at the end of the document. ESLint did not like to many spaces toward the end of the document. Another error had to do with strings I put in double quotes. ESLint wanted the double quotes to be single quotes. Both of these were not necessarily coding errors, but more so "ESLint errors." My code would run fine, but according to ESLint my formatting was wrong. This was such a pain to deal with this week, because I did not know how to fix these errors. I thought it was very pointless because as long as the code runs, what would it matter if I had to many spaces or if I didn't put double quotes somewhere? I did not understand.
