# Lyrics and Music 
You might be wondering why I am talking about music and lyrics. Well these two go hand in hand with each other obviously. Every song has different types of lyrics associated with it, but lyrics don't always have to be associated with a particular genre of music. An example would be a lyrics in a country song. The lyrics don't always have to be associated with country, but it can be adopted into another genre of music such as pop. The lyrics don't change, just the genre of music it is associated with. Everyone of us has a particular genre or genres of music we like. If we like the lyrics to a song, but not necessarily the genre it is associated with we can probably find an alternative version on the internet. If we can't find it, we may experiment and create a version of the song on our own.
