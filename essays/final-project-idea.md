# Overview
The problem: Many students at UH Manoa are looking for a place to live off campus and would like to to live with other students. Unfortunately their is no easy way for them to get into contact with each other because they don't know one another. 
The solution: The Off-Campus Club application allows students to connect with other student who would like to live off campus. The application allows them to find a perfect roommate with similar interests. 
# Approach 
Students will create their own personal profile with important information such as: hobbies, habits, cleanliness, pets, etc. 
Students can get notified when they have a match. 
Admins can monitor for inappropriate content and other information.
Login will only accept hawaii.edu email. 
Some mockup pages include: 
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- Club admin home page.
- Browse roommates by interest area(s).
