# Overview
The problem: Many students at UH Manoa are looking for a place to live off campus and would like to live with other students. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for them to get into contact with each other because they don't know one another.  

The solution: The Off-Campus Rommates application allows students to connect with other students who would like to live off campus. The application allows them to find a perfect roommate with similar interests. 

# Approach 
Students will create their own personal profile with important information such as hobbies, habits, cleanliness, pets, etc. 
Students can get notified when they have a match. 
Admins can monitor for inappropriate content and other information.
Login will only accept hawaii.edu email. 
Some mockup pages include: 
- Landing page
- User homepage
- Admin home page
- Roommates admin home page.
- Browse roommates by interest area(s).

# Use case ideas
- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. 
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, finds roommates with compatible interests, contacts them.

# Beyond the basics 
- Support living in specific areas/towns
- Supports the rating of the roommate and location (e.g. 5 stars)
