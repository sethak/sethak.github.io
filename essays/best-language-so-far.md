Coming into ICS 314 I did not know what to expect. All my friends would talk about would be how they built websites. I thought we would be buidling websites using some sort of website template. I did not anticipate we would be using JavaScript. Learning JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp was very helpful and from doing that I was able to learn a lot about the language. I am still no where near perfect, but I do have a sense of the basics. Personally going back to that website will be very helpful because I will be able to build a solid foundation and start getting good at the basics. Being good at the basics will help me be able to start doing advanced levels things.
