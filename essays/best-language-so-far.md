Coming into ICS 314 I did not know what to expect. All my friends would talk about would be how they built websites. I thought we would be buidling websites using some sort of website template. I did not anticipate we would be using JavaScript. Learning JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp was very helpful and from doing that I was able to learn a lot about the language. I am still no where near perfect, but I do have a sense of the basics. Personally going back to that website will be very helpful because I will be able to build a solid foundation and start getting good at the basics. Being good at the basics will help me be able to start doing advanced levels things.

I am not very familiar with many languages as I have just started my computer science career. Coming from my perspecitve I really enjoy JavaScript, I never had any experience with it and the language is fun to learn. I enjoy it because it doesn't seem as complicated to learn so far. Comparing this with the other languages I know (C, C++, java) it is the easiest so far. I think that JavaScript is a very good language to learn because it has to do with web development, which is very important. If I had the oppurtunity to pick which language to start off with it would be this one. I feel like this language is very user friendly because it is pretty easy to understand. I believe JavaScript is a great language to start with because students will be able to pick up this language quickly and it will be much easier on the teacher. Once students get a deeper understanding of JavaScript they will be able to pick up the harder languages easier. Since this is one of the easier languages to learn students can really learn the principles and the basics of computer science. Understanding the principles and basics of computer science as a whole will make it that much easier to learn different languages.
