# New Tools  
Learning HTML and CSS last week was something very new to me. I was use to coding in languages such as Java or C. HTML and CSS were totally new to me and I had no idea what to expect from it. When I first started I really enjoyed it. The indentation and all these new types of classes were very interesting. This was basically a new language that I had to learn, but it was a language that almost seems like English in various ways. Java and everything felt more like "coding" to me. HTML and CSS felt like I was trying to tell the computer to get something doen, but in English. This week we moved onto UI Frameworks and specifically Semantic UI, which is used to create websites. Going into this class I didn't really know what to expect, but seeing the process of building websites and actually getting to do it now is awesome! I've never really thought about websites much, but after this past week I have a new fascination for them. Now that I am exposed to UI Frameworks I am excited to dig deeper and to create more websites in the future. HTML, CSS, and UI Frameworks are very powerful tools that are going to not only help me in this class, but with my future in the computer science field.
