# New Tools  
Learning HTML and CSS last week was something very new to me. I was use to coding in languages such as Java or C. HTML and CSS were totally new to me and I had no idea what to expect from it. When I first started I really enjoyed it. The indentation and all these new types of classes were very interesting. This was basically a new language that I had to learn, but it was a language that almost seems like English in various ways. Java and everything felt more like "coding" to me. HTML and CSS felt like I was trying to tell the computer to get something doen, but in English. This week we moved onto UI Frameworks and specifically Semantic UI, which is used to create websites. Going into this class I didn't really know what to expect, but seeing the process of building websites and actually getting to do it now is awesome! I've never really thought about websites much, but after this past week I have a new fascination for them. Now that I am exposed to UI Frameworks I am excited to dig deeper and to create more websites in the future. HTML, CSS, and UI Frameworks are very powerful tools that are going to not only help me in this class, but with my future in the computer science field. 
# Nothing Good Ever Comes Easy 
Working hard in anything you do has a really great payoff. With Semantic UI, their was nothing different. I had to spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with the new syntax, classes, variables, etc. This was a big challenge because it wasn't like any language that I have used. The classes were so different from what I have learned up to this point. I had to use things such as "containers" and putting itms in "div" tags. I had no idea what these meant. Doing the practice WODS were really a struggle because it was confusing on where to put everything to make sure the website looked good. The practice WODS involved recreating websites and I found it frustrating at times that the website did not look exactly the way I wanted it too. I tried many different things, but I couldn't get it to look the way I wanted it too. I didn't give up though and kept on practicing it over and over again. Each time was less and less painful. Eventually I started to get the hang of it and it started to be fun. 
# Working Hard Always Pays Off 
Practicing and actually taking the time will make you successful. This goes for everything that you do in your life. Practing Semantic UI and keeping at it really helped me. I am getting more and more comfortable each time that I use it and it's starting to be a lot more fun. I am trying to recreate websites on my own time to get more practice and to get better each time. I am always trying for perfection and making the website to be exactly or very close to the original. Semantic UI is so very rewarding because being able to view your progress as you go makes it that much better. It is so rewarding to see the final product and it closely resembles the orginal. Being able to look at your code and see the result of it makes you feel good. You can say, "Wow I actually buiilt that website." The cool thing about Semantic UI is that it is very powerful and their are so many tools that you can use. You have these tools at your own fingertips. Each website is different and being able to use many different types of tools for each website makes you that much better and more comfortable with Semantic UI. Semantic UI was very frustrating to begin with, but after spending several hours and days on it, I feel like that it is a useful tool.
