summary: Field Training was an experience that challenged me mentally, physically, and emotionally.

This wasn't necessarily a project, but more of an experience that I learned a lot from. This training I went to was called LEAD, or Leadership Evaluation and Development. This is the basic training for cadets who are trying to be officers in the United States Air Force. The length was 19 days long and it took place in Alabama and Mississippi. We spent the first 10 days in Alabama and the last 9 in Mississippi. In Alabama we focused on marching, uniform inspections, discipline, and leadership skills. In Mississippi we focused on discipline and leadership skills, but in a simulated deployment type of environment. The goal of this training was to evaluate each cadets leadership skills through various tests. Not everyone made it, but those who do are that much closer to being a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. This is the biggest hurdle for any cadet throughout their ROTC career and I was fortunate enough to make it through.
