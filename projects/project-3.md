summary: Field Training was an experience that challenged me mentally, physically, and emotionally.

This wasn't necessarily a project, but more of an experience that I learned a lot from. This training I went to was called LEAD, or Leadership Evaluation and Development. This is the basic training for cadets who are trying to be officers in the United States Air Force. The length was 19 days long and it took place in Alabama and Mississippi. We spent the first 10 days in Alabama and the last 9 in Mississippi. In Alabama we focused on marching, uniform inspections, discipline, and leadership skills. In Mississippi we focused on discipline and leadership skills, but in a simulated deployment type of environment. The goal of this training was to evaluate each cadets leadership skills through various tests. Not everyone made it, but those who do are that much closer to being a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. This is the biggest hurdle for any cadet throughout their ROTC career and I was fortunate enough to make it through. 

Field Training is something that may seem like it can be done alone, but in reality it is the exact opposite. You need to rely on your cadets that are put into the same group as you. It was a total team effort in everything we did. Their is no way I could have gotten through this alone and I would have failed miserably if I even tried. Their were times throughout field training where you are put in charge of problems and you must lead and show the evaluator the skills you have learned throughout ROTC up to that point. Even though at times I would be the leader, I relied a lot on my teammates to help us accomplish the goal. I made the final decisions, but I needed my group every step of the way. Field Training was for sure a group effort because like I said you literally need your group every second of the day. Their were days that were harder to get through than others because I missed home and talking to my friends and family. My group, which is now my second family, helped me get through these times. We all helped each other out and picked one another up whenever we were down.
