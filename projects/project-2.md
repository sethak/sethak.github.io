summary: My second career project in my computer science career that involves collecting moving objects. 
---

Mayhem was my second project that I ever created in my computer science career. The basic idea of the project was to collect all the coins that were moving while avoiding obstacles at the same time. This was pretty similar to my first project, but it involved moving objects. It may seem like the code is the same, in many ways it is, but to get the coins to move around the screen more code needed to be written. I enjoyed making this project because I built upon the many lessons I learned from my first project. 

This was another solo project and all the code was written by me. I was able to seek help whenever I needed it, but all the code and everything in the project was written by me. 

I was able to learn a lot from this project as well. This project was similar to the first one, but involved more. An example was the movement of the coins. This project took me more time than usual because it was more difficult. It required a lot of patience and their were times where I would get frustrated when something wouldn't work. A great tip is to never be afraid to ask questions and to work in groups. Like we are learning in ICS 314 right now, someone may be able to spot an error much quicker than you. For this project I learned to use my resources more such as the internet whenever I would get stuck and this really helped a lot.
