summary: My second career project in my computer science career that involves collecting moving objects. 
---

Mayhem was my second project that I ever created in my computer science career. The basic idea of the project was to collect all the coins that were moving while avoiding obstacles at the same time. 

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
