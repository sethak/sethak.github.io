My group members included Sean Motogawa, Justin Bishay, William Bijansky, and myself. Our project was called study hall. The point of our project was to get additional help for students that need help. Students are pretty busy and are not always avaliable when the teachers hold office hours or when tutors hold tutor sessions.
