My group members included Sean Motogawa, Justin Bishay, William Bijansky, and myself. Our project was called study hall. The point of our project was to get additional help for students that need help. Students are pretty busy and are not always available when the teachers hold office hours or when tutors hold tutor sessions. Students are able to register themselves as users or tutors. The users are able to register for tutor sessions and the class they need tutoring in. The tutors have the ability to hold big study groups. If the user is not comfortable with big groups they can instant message tutors to get that one-on-one help. This web application can also help with students meeting other students from their class or different classes. This can be helpful because they can form groups with one another to study. Our main goal was to give students another option to get the help they need. It also provides you a chance to help as a tutor too. 

I was assigned to do create the user profile page, which would allow the user to put in information such as there name, email, address, etc. I was also tasked with creating an "Add Tutor" page. This was important because it gave the admin the ability to add tutors or take tutors off if necessary. The last task was to do a clean up and modify code by making it cleaner. This was another important step because I got rid of things that were not necessary and simplified the code to make it simpler to read. 

I was able to learn a lot from this project. It wasn't just working on the project itself, but working with team members. I found it challenging at times to work with one another because we were on different pages. It got frustrating at times because I would do my part one way, but some group members wanted it done another way. My group and I got along very well though so it made it easier to work with one another. It is very important to plan ahead before you even code anything. We did not do that at the beginning, but did it as the project went along. Planning is important because you can all get on the same page and the process is much smoother. Another important lesson I learned was to be patient. I would be trying to get my page to work and sometimes it didn't work right away. Sometimes it wouldn't work for a long period of time. During this project I learned to step away from my computer. I would relax and go do something else. This turned out to be very helpful because I was able to gather my thoughts and have a clear mind. It helped me find the solutions and what I was doing wrong. This project really taught me a lot and I am happy the way the application turned out.
