My group members included Sean Motogawa, Justin Bishay, William Bijansky, and myself. Our project was called study hall. The point of our project was to get additional help for students that need help. Students are pretty busy and are not always avaliable when the teachers hold office hours or when tutors hold tutor sessions. Students are able to register themselves as users or tutors. The users are able to register for tutor sessions and the class they need tutoring in. The tutors have the ability to hold big study groups. If the user is not comfotable with big groups they can instant message tutors to get that one on one help. This web application can also help with students meeting other students from their class or different classes. This can be helpful because they can form groups with one another to study. Our main goal was to give students another option to get the help they need. It also provides you a chance to help as a tutor too. 

I was assigned to do create the user profile page, which would allow the user to put in information such as there name, email, address, etc. I was also tasked with creating an "Add Tutor" page. This was important because it gave the admin the ability to add tutors or take tutors off if necessary. The last task was to do a clean up and modify code by making it cleaner. This was another important step because I got rid of things that were not necessary and simplified the code to make it simpler to read.
